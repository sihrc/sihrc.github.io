<h2> Building Java Projects and LWJGL </h2>

I've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/pong-the-moba/play-pong-the-moba"> Pong Variant </a> with a friend. Building this project just got a whole lot harder when we decided to pack jars for play testing.

<h3> Using Gradle </h3>
Using gradle has eased a lot of the pain building this project. Originally when I first joined this project, there were fat jars lying in a folder somewhere, and a couple of directories that contained entire java projects used a module dependencies as well. Cloning the repo itself took quite a bit.
