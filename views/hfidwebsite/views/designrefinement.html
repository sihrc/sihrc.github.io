      <h3>User Group and Primary Needs</h3>
      The user group that we are designing our myDish app for is primary family meal providers. Our definition of ‘primary family meal providers’ is the person/people in a family that does most of the cooking and/or grocery shopping for the whole family. As a result of our user visits, our team discovered one universal need among our users: saving time in the meal preparation process, and more specifically improving efficiency and organization when they are cooking meals for their families. The specific problem we are addressing is the waste of time and lack of organization in the method of storing and finding past meals. Currently, users have meals documented in several different types of media strewn across various sources that are oftentimes easily destroyed or lost. This makes it hard for them to manage and access their meals. The myDish app provides the documentation and organization of meals in an imperishable, accessible, and portable form.

      <h3>Prototype Description</h3>
      Meet our first prototype! The myDish app is a digital personal cookbook for each individual user. It serves as a place to save the dishes that a user has made for quick reference in the future and as a central location for all the recipes that a user cares about. 
      <br> <br>
      <h4>All Entries Page</h4>

      <center><img src='../assets/images/designrefinement/allEntries.jpg'> </center><br> <br>

      The main page of the app is an Instagram/Facebook-like list of the dishes that a user has entered most recently. The information displayed for each dish includes the title and picture of the dish. From this page, the user has the option to either click on the picture of one of the dishes, which will lead them to the view/edit entry page, or click on the ‘Add Entry’ button in order to navigate to the add entry page.
      <br> <br>
      <h4>Add Entry Page</h4>

      <center><img src='../assets/images/designrefinement/addEntry.jpg'></center><br><br>
      
      The add entry page is where the user can enter a new dish into their myDish app. They have the option to add a title, to retake the photo if they are not happy with it, to write down the recipe, to choose categories which the dish falls under (like appetizer, entree, dessert, etc), and to write down any notes. Hitting cancel or save will bring them back to the main page; if the user saved the dish, it will appear at the top of the feed on the main page.
      <br><br>
      <h4>View/Edit Entry Page</h4>

      <center><img src='../assets/images/designrefinement/editEntry.jpg'></center><br><br>

      The view/edit entry page displays all of the information about the entry in editable fields. The user can view their previous notes, or if they choose to they can edit the title, recipe, categories, and notes as well as retake the photo. From this page, the user has three options: going back to the main screen, saving the changes they made, or sharing the entry. If the user chooses to go back to the main screen, any changes that they might have made to the entry will not be saved. If they choose the ‘save’ option, they will also be returned to the main page, but with their changes saved. Finally, if they choose the share option, they will see the popup shown in the next section.
      <br><br>
      <h4>Sharing Options</h4>
      
      <center><img src='../assets/images/designrefinement/share.jpg'></center><br><br>
      
      When the user chooses to press the share button on the top right corner of the edit entry page, several options for sharing come up including email, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Although we chose to prototype just these four icons, pressing share would connect to your phone and bring up all the applications and ways through which you could share a recipe on your mobile device. From this screen, the user would be taken outside of this application into whatever application they selected from the popup menu.

      <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
      <br><br>
      <h4>All Entries Page</h4>

      Our major design decisions on the “all entries” page involved what the user could see on the main screen and how the user could access other screens - viewing entry details, sharing entries, and editing entries. As shown below, in our original paper prototype we had it so that for each entry on the page, the user could see the title, date, a share button, and an edit button. 

      <center><img src="../assets/images/design/task_sarah.jpg"></center><br><br>

      During our paper prototype testing we found several issues with our paper prototype. For one, users were confused about what the date meant - was it the last time the meal was prepared, the date the entry was created, or today’s date? Probing further, we came to understand that the date was not at all significant to our users; they only cared whether a dish had been made more or less recently than another one. As a result, we decided to take out the visual representation of the date and simply used it in our back-end implementation. The entries’ dates would update so that the most recently added or edited entry showed up on top to give the user immediate feedback when adding or editing entries.  This method of sorting also made sense because entries that the user has not viewed/edited recently would appear further down the list, allowing the user to see their favorites earlier on when browsing the app.

      In addition to the date, there were also problems with the edit and share buttons for each entry. Because many of our  users are not familiar with social media or mobile applications, they did not recognize the button icons that we used for sharing and editing. To address that problem, we changed the icons to clickable text buttons, labelled as the action that the button maps to. We also noticed that regardless of the task (either viewing, editing, or sharing) that we asked our users to perform, their initial instinct was to tap the picture for any action related to the dish in question. As such, we removed all the buttons from the main page and simply connected a tap of the picture to a screen that allowed users to view, at the same time edit, and share, which resulted in a clean, intuitive, and minimalistic design as shown below.
      <br><br>
      <center><img src='../assets/images/designrefinement/afterAllEntries.jpg'></center><br><br><br>
      <h4>Add Entry Page</h4>

      <div class = "span10">
        <center><img width = "200px" height = "auto" src = "../assets/images/paperprototypes/lisa1.jpg"></img>
        <img  width = "200px" height = "auto" src = "../assets/images/paperprototypes/lisa2.jpg"></img></center>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      There were several changes to our add entry page that came about due to our conversations with our users. During our paper prototyping sessions, we offered our users the ability to rate their dishes on a scale of one through five stars. While some users simply rated their dish four or five stars, some asked us, “Why would we even save our dish in this app if it was only a one star dish?” They brought up a great point - our app is designed to help users store their great dishes for the future, so allowing them to add and save dishes they would never want to make again just didn’t make sense. Instead, our users wanted a better way to organize their dishes, especially by category. Some requested standard categories like breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizers, desserts; others wanted to be able to sort by ingredient, like vegetarian, chicken, etc. We populated our application with the generic “entree, appetizer, dessert” categories and added an “other” category for users to fill in their own categories.

      We also found during our paper prototyping sessions that our users were confused by what information should go in the notes box. If we provided them an example prior to asking them to use our prototype, such as, “Oh, here you can write something like, ‘My daughter really likes this dish,’” then they would come up with a similar note when they added a new dish. However, without this example, they immediately started listing ingredients, writing a condensed version of a recipe. When we asked them about this, they told us they would want to store the recipe in the app. Our concern was that it would be too time consuming for someone to type up a recipe on their phone. However, because our users have mostly paper cookbooks and recipes in notebooks, they feel the need to transfer these recipes to have an electronic copy, and an application like this one was appealing to them as a way to store their numerous recipes. Based on their feedback, we added a recipes section as well as a notes section for them to input when they add a dish to the myDish app.
      <br><br>
      <center><img src="../assets/images/designrefinement/addEntry.jpg"></center><br><br>
      <h4>View/Edit Entry Page</h4>

      In the “all entries” section, we described how we moved to tapping the picture to get to the edit entry page, which also doubles as a view entry page with editable fields. We made a couple of design decisions regarding how the user can edit each field once they get to this page.

      Originally, we considered having edit buttons next to each field so that if users wanted to edit the specific field, they could tap the edit button to change the contents. Then, at the bottom of the screen was a “go back” button that took the user back to the “all entries” page.

      During prototype testing, we found that our users found the “save” button on our “add entry” page intuitive and wanted to implement a similar “save” button for the edit entry page, which saved all changes made on the entry.  We also considered the fact that because this application is a mobile application, users are required to first tap the text box before the field is editable, so having an additional edit button that performed the same action was unnecessary. As a result, we also removed the individual edit buttons and simply allowed each text box to be editable in the same way.

      Below is a repeated image of our final edit entry page for reference. We did not have a fully prototyped version of an edit entry with individual edit buttons because this design decision was made during the prototyping process.<br><br>

      <center><img src="../assets/images/designrefinement/afterAllEntries.jpg"></center>

      <br><br>
      <h4>Sharing Options</h4>

      <br><br>
      <div class = "span10">
        <center><img width = "200px" height = "auto" src = "../assets/images/paperprototypes/ari1.jpg"></img>

      </div><br><br>

      To test out the intuitiveness of our sharing page, we had our users share a meal on Facebook during our paper prototype testing, which required selecting the share button (located next to the title) and selecting the Facebook button from among the other sharing options such as email, chat, Instagram, and Twitter.

      Our users also quickly indicated to us that they would not usually share the meal on Facebook. If they just wanted to share an image of a meal, they would most likely go directly on the Facebook app and share. They did however ask us whether the app was capable of sending the meal by email, and most importantly, send the recipes associated with the meal. From this we discovered just how important emailing is to our users. One user emphasized how her generation was a very email oriented generation and conversed online usually through email. We also found that our users share their recipes more often than we thought, and would share more if there was an easier method of doing so.

      Originally our users had to press a share button with the share icon located next to the title. As mentioned previously, we quickly discovered that our users did not recognize the symbol and were confused where the share button was. Most attempted to click on the image of the meal in order to search for the share button there. To make it more straightforward, our share button was changed such that the word "share" was on the button. 

      <br><br><center><img src="../assets/images/designrefinement/share.jpg"></center><br><br>

      Note that we did not implement the page after selecting the mode of sharing because that would be handled by an external application.

      <h3>Shortcomings and Improvement Areas</h3>

      Either due to the limited prototyping time, or the difficulty of implementation, we were unable to include the option to search for entries via title name and/or category, and to add recipes by methods other than typing the recipe in.

      <br><br><center><img src="../assets/images/design/search.png"></center><br><br>

      The search option would have made it much quicker for users to search for a specific meal, rather than forcing the user to scroll through the entire list. Scrolling would become more tedious as more recipes were added to the app, so search is definitely a function that should be implemented.

      We had originally created the ability to categorize meals because our users wanted the ability to search for meals that fell into specific categories such as "dinner" meals, or "chicken" meals. Implement the search feature would not only let our users search by recipe, but also by category.

      <br><br><center><img src="../assets/images/design/recipes.png">  <img src="../assets/images/design/recipes2.png"></center><br><br>

      One of the big questions we had during the user testing phase was how we wanted our users to add recipes to their dishes. We originally rejected the idea of adding recipes, believing that this would be too complicated to implement in a simple enough way for our users, but our users highly recommended this during our user testing. We found out that our users had recently begun making recipes electronic and would be perfectly happy with typing the recipes by hand.

      Since we did not consider the option of adding recipes until the middle of the the paper prototype testing phase, we were not able to investigate this as thoroughly as we would have liked. Some ideas we’ve considered are taking pictures of paper recipes (since many of our users have paper cookbooks), or importing recipes from external websites because our users search for recipes online.

      Going forward, we may also want to explore how our users want notes to be managed, but that is less important in terms of impact and usability.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      Some key insights that we had during our design process were mostly in the realm of designing a mobile application for users who do not have as much experience with using mobile applications. 

      At this point we would first like to re-address the possible question of why we decided to design a mobile app for a user group that does not have experience with mobile applications. To clarify, our users do have access to mobile technology and do use it for very basic functionalities (viewing emails and other documents). We concluded that it was perfectly valid and in fact ideal for our application to be on a mobile application because our users were in favor of a personal cookbook (a conglomeration of all their strewn recipe books, snippets, and scribbles) in the palm of their hand - portable, imperishable, and accessible, which addressed their needs for organization and time efficiency. The insight here is that it may be necessary to design an application on an non-intuitive platform for users, and as a result, special design techniques must be considered in producing a good design, leading to the next insight.

      Despite the standardization of icons, actions, and representations found across applications on mobile devices, we were unable to leverage these existing designs because our targeted users are not familiar with these standardizations. This was a fairly impactful insight because it defied one design heuristic in support of another. Standardizations are not useful in the case of users who are not familiar with the standardizations, and instead, speaking the users’ language, which in our case was email and computers, is preferred.
