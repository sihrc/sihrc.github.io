    <h2> Final Design Refinement </h2>
    <p> This is our final design refinement where we present the myDish app. We discuss the needs of our users, the design of the myDish app, and the design choices our team made. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <p>Imagine a mother who is preparing dinner for her family. She opens the refrigerator and looks at the assortment of foods scattered across the shelves. “What can I make for dinner?” she wonders. Nothing catches her eye and she is having a hard time coming up with a creative meal that will be delicious and nutritious for her family. How much easier would it be if she could simply pull out her phone, open an application, and find inspiration by scrolling through a list of meals and recipes that she has found to be tried and true in the past?</p>

      <p>Over the course of this past semester, our team designed and developed a web application called myDish. The myDish app can be thought of as an individual digital cookbook where users are able to take pictures of the meals they cook, record their recipes and any notes they have on their dishes, and upload them to their own personal feed. This application will not only be a place to store recipes, it will also be a source of inspiration for our users who can open the application and scroll through the dishes they’ve previously made in order to brainstorm what they can cook for their next meal. Users can use the myDish application in many ways. Some will use it for inspiration while making meal plans in order to cook balanced meals, others will use it to share their exquisite meals with others in order to receive feedback and validation, and still others will use the app to keep track of a set of recipes that they enjoy making.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>User Group and Primary Needs</h3>
      <p>We designed the myDish app for primary family meal providers, or the person in a family that does most of the cooking and/or grocery shopping for the whole family. As a result of our user visits, our team discovered one universal need among our users: saving time in the meal preparation process and, more specifically, improving efficiency and organization when they are cooking meals for their families. The specific problem we addressed was the waste of time and lack of organization in the method of storing and finding past meals. Currently, users have meals documented in several different types of media strewn across various sources that are oftentimes easily destroyed or lost. This makes it hard for them to manage and access their meal recipes. The myDish app provides the documentation and organization of meals in an imperishable, accessible, and portable form.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Final Prototype Description</h3>
      <h4>The Main Page</h4>

      <div class="app-view">
        <img src='../assets/images/finalrefinement/MainPage.PNG'>
      </div>

      <p>The main page of the app is similar to Instagram or the Facebook newsfeed; a list of the dishes that a user has saved are listed in reverse chronological order. The information displayed for each dish includes the title and picture of the dish. From this page, the user has the option to either click on the picture of one of the dishes, which will lead them to the view and edit dish page, or click on the ‘Add Dish’ button in order to navigate to the add dish page. </p>
      
      <h4>Add Dish Page</h4>

      <div class="app-view">
        <img src='../assets/images/finalrefinement/AddDishPage.PNG'>
      </div>
      
      <p>The add dish page is where the user can enter a new dish into their myDish app. They have the option to add a title, to take a photo (or retake the photo if they are not happy with it), to write down the recipe, to choose categories which the dish falls under (like appetizer, entree, dessert, etc), and to write down any notes they may have about the recipe. Hitting cancel or save will bring them back to the main page; if the user saved the dish, it will appear at the top of the feed on the main page.</p> 
      
      <h4>View and Edit Page</h4>

      <div class="app-view">
        <img src='../assets/images/finalrefinement/EditDishPage.PNG'>
      </div>

      <p>The view/edit entry page displays all of the information about the entry in editable fields. The user can view their previous notes, or if they choose to they can edit the title, recipe, categories, and notes as well as retake the photo. From this page, the user has three options: going back to the main screen, saving the changes they made, or sharing the entry. If the user chooses to go back to the main screen, any changes that they might have made to the entry will not be saved. If they choose the ‘save’ option, they will also be returned to the main page, but with their changes saved. Finally, if they choose the share option, they will see the popup shown in the next section.</p>
      
      <h4>Sharing Options</h4>
      
      <div class="app-view">
        <img src='../assets/images/finalrefinement/SharePage.PNG'>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>When the user chooses to press the share button on the top right corner of the view and edit page, several options for sharing come up including email, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Although we chose to prototype just these four icons, pressing share would connect to your phone and bring up all the applications and ways through which you could share a recipe on your mobile device. From this screen, the user would be taken outside of this application into whatever application they selected from the popup menu.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Design Justificaiton</h3>
      
      <h4>The Main Page</h4>

      <p>Our major design decisions on the “all entries” page involved what the user could see on the main screen and how the user could access other screens - viewing dish details, sharing recipes, and editing entries. As shown below, in our original paper prototype we had it so that for each dish on the page, the user could see the title, date, a share button, and an edit button.</p>

      <div class = "pproto-large">
        <img src="../assets/images/design/task_sarah.jpg">
      </div>

      <p>During our paper prototype testing we found several issues with this design. For one, users were confused about what the date meant - was it the last time the meal was prepared, the date the entry was created, or today’s date? Probing further, we came to understand that the date was not at all significant to our users; they only cared whether a dish had been made more or less recently than the other ones. As a result, we decided to take out the visual representation of the date and simply used it in our back-end implementation. The entries’ dates would update so that the most recently added or edited entry showed up on top to give the user immediate feedback when adding or editing entries. This method of sorting also made sense because entries that the user had not viewed or edited recently would appear further down the list, allowing the user to see their favorites earlier on when browsing the app.</p> 

      <p>In addition to the date, there were also problems with the edit and share buttons for each entry. Because many of our users are not familiar with social media or mobile applications, they did not recognize the standard button icons that we used for sharing and editing. To address that issue, we changed the icons to clickable text buttons, labelled as the action that the button maps to. We also noticed that regardless of the task (whether it was viewing, editing, or sharing), the initial instinct for each of our users was to tap the picture for any action related to the dish in question. As such, we removed all the buttons from the main page and made it so tapping on the picture of the dish would lead to a screen that allowed users to view, edit, and share dishes, which resulted in a clean, intuitive, and minimalistic design as shown below.</p>
      
      <div class = "pproto-large">
        <img src='../assets/images/designrefinement/afterAllEntries.jpg'>
      </div>

      <h4>Add Entry Page</h4>

      <div class="double-app-view">
        <div class="app-view-left">
          <img src = "../assets/images/paperprototypes/lisa1.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="app-view-right">
          <img src = "../assets/images/paperprototypes/lisa2.jpg">
        </div>      
      </div>
      
      <p>There were several changes to our add dish page that came about due to our conversations with our users. During our paper prototyping sessions, we offered our users the ability to rate their dishes on a scale of one through five stars. While some users simply rated their dish four or five stars, some asked us, “Why would we even save our dish in this app if it was only a one star dish?” They brought up a great point - our app is designed to help users store their great dishes for the future, so allowing them to add and save dishes they would never want to make again just didn’t make sense. Instead, our users wanted to organize their dishes by category. Some requested standard categories like breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizers, desserts; others wanted to be able to sort by ingredient, like vegetarian, chicken, etc. To keep things simple, we populated our application with the generic “entree, appetizer, dessert” categories. </p>

      <p>We also found during our paper prototyping sessions that our users were confused by what information should go in the notes box. If we provided them an example prior to asking them to use our prototype, such as, “Oh, here you can write something like, ‘My daughter really likes this dish,’” then they would come up with a similar note when they added a new dish. However, without this example, they immediately started listing ingredients, writing a condensed version of a recipe. When we asked them about this, they told us they would want to store the recipe in the app. We had not included a recipe section in our paper prototype because we were concerned that it would be too time consuming for someone to type up a recipe on their phone. However, because our users have mostly paper cookbooks and recipes in notebooks, they feel the need to transfer these recipes to have an electronic copy, and an application like this one was appealing to them as a way to store their numerous recipes. Based on their feedback, we added a recipes section as well as a notes section for them to input when they add a dish to the myDish app. </p>
      
      <div class="app-view">
        <img src="../assets/images/designrefinement/addEntry.jpg">
      </div>
      <h4>View/Edit Entry Page</h4>

      <p>In the “all entries” section, we described how we moved to tapping the picture to get to the edit page, which also doubles as a view dish page with editable fields. We made a couple of design decisions regarding how the user can edit each field once they get to this page. Originally, we considered having edit buttons next to each field so that if users wanted to edit the specific field, they could tap the edit button to change the contents. Then, at the bottom of the screen was a “go back” button that took the user back to the main “all entries” page. </p>

      <p>During prototype testing, we found that our users found the “save” button on our “add dish” page intuitive and wanted to implement a similar “save” button for the edit entry page, which saved all changes made on the entry. We also considered the fact that because this application is a mobile application, users are required to first tap the text box before the field is editable, so having an additional edit button that performed the same action was unnecessary. As a result, we also removed the individual edit buttons and simply allowed each text box to be editable in the same way. Below is a repeated image of our final edit entry page for reference. We did not have a fully prototyped version of an edit entry with individual edit buttons because this design decision was made during the prototyping process.</p>

      <p>In our initial prototype, we identified the recipe and notes text boxes by placing the labels as filler text inside the text boxes themselves. It was pointed out to us through a heuristic evaluation that the labels would permanently disappear once users had edited the text boxes, making it unclear to them what field they had entered information into. To remedy this, we decided to place permanent labels above the text boxes instead, labeling each text box as either “Recipe” or “Notes.”</p>

      <div class = "pproto-large">
        <img src='../assets/images/designrefinement/afterAllEntries.jpg'>
      </div>

      
      <h4>Sharing Options</h4>

      <div class="double-app-view">
        <div class="app-view-left">
          <img src = "../assets/images/paperprototypes/ari1.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="app-view-right">
          <img src = "../assets/images/paperprototypes/ari3.jpg">
        </div>      
      </div>

      <p>To test out the intuitiveness of our sharing page, we had our users share a meal on Facebook during our paper prototype testing, which required selecting the share button (located next to the title) and selecting the Facebook button from among the other sharing options such as email, chat, Instagram, and Twitter. </p>

      <p>Our users quickly indicated to us that they would not usually share the meal on Facebook. If they just wanted to share an image of a meal, they would most likely go directly on the Facebook app and share. They did, however, ask us whether the app was capable of sending the image through email, and more importantly, if they would be able to send the recipes associated with the meal. From this we discovered just how important emailing is to our users. One user emphasized how her generation was a very email oriented generation and conversed online usually through email. We also found that our users share their recipes more often than we originally thought, and would share them even more often if there was an easier method of doing so.</p>

      <p>Originally our users had to press a share button with the share icon located next to the title. As mentioned previously, we quickly discovered that our users did not recognize the symbol and were confused where the share button was. Most attempted to click on the image of the meal in order to search for the share button there. To make it more straightforward, our share button was changed such that the word "share" was on the button. </p>

      <p>Note that we did not implement the page after selecting the mode of sharing because that would be handled by an external application.</p>

      <h3>Formal Usability Testing</h3>

      <p>Our team had been debating whether or not the notes section on the add dish page of our app was useful for our users. To test this, we created three designs of the app in which:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The recipe text box is above the notes text box</li>
        <li>The notes text box is above the recipe text box</li>
        <li>There is only a recipe text box provided (there is no notes text box)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Testers were given the task of adding a meal that they had made recently to the app. This meal was familiar enough to the user that they could recall the recipe from memory. </p>

      <p>We completed the usability test with two of our users. For our formal usability testing, they both showed a preference for having the notes section and entered notes for each of the recipes that they put into the application. They noticed and were displeased when the notes section was not present.</p>

      <p>Comparing the two different designs, one where the recipe section was followed by the notes section and the other where the notes section was followed by the recipe section, our users held opposing viewpoints. One user said she liked having the notes section before the recipe section because the notes were more important to her than the recipe when she was looking for a meal to make, and she liked having her notes more visible than the recipe. The other user said she liked having the recipe section before the notes section, saying, “It’s just the way my mind works”. Because we were only able to get two data points, we do not have a strong conclusion on which design is better. If we were to conduct this study with more users, we would be able to see if our users generally preferred to see the notes or the recipe first. In either case, however, we are certain that our users value the notes section and that it should be included in our final design.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Shortcomings and Improvement Areas</h3>

      <p>Due to the limited prototyping time and difficulties with implementation, we were unable to include the option to search for entries via title and/or category. We also did not include the feature where the user could add recipes by methods other than typing the recipe in. </p>

      <div class="app-view">
        <img src="../assets/images/design/search.png">
      </div>

      <p>The search option would have made finding a recipe much quicker for our users because they could search for a specific meal rather than scrolling through the entire list. Scrolling would become more tedious as more recipes were added to the app, so search is definitely a function that should be implemented. We had originally created the ability to categorize meals because our users wanted the ability to search for meals that fell into specific categories such as "dinner" meals, or "chicken" meals. Implementing the search feature would not only let our users search by recipe, but also by category.</p>

      <div class="double-app-view">
        <div class="app-view-left">
          <img src="../assets/images/design/recipes.png"> 
        </div>
        <div class="app-view-right">
          <img src="../assets/images/design/recipes2.png">
        </div>      
      </div>
       

      <p>One of the big questions we had during the user testing phase was how we wanted our users to add recipes to their dishes. We originally rejected the idea of adding recipes, believing that this would be too complicated to implement in a simple enough way for our users, but our users highly recommended this during our user testing. We found out that our users had recently begun making recipes electronic and would be perfectly happy with typing the recipes. </p>

      <p>Since we did not consider the option of adding recipes until the middle of the the paper prototype testing phase, we were not able to investigate this as thoroughly as we would have liked. Some ideas we’ve considered are taking pictures of paper recipes (since many of our users have paper cookbooks), or importing recipes from external websites because our users search for recipes online. Going forward, we may also want to explore how our users want notes to be managed, but that is less important in terms of impact and usability.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>

      <p>The myDish app has proven to be a simple, intuitive web application serving its users as a digital cookbook. Users can seek inspiration for future meals, share meals with friends, and hold all of their recipes in one place all within the myDish app. From all of the benefits the myDish app provides, users most value the time that they save by using the myDish app in the craziness of their everyday lives. The ability to store all of their commonly made meals in one place in order to answer the question, “honey, what should we have for dinner tonight?”, makes the myDish an invaluable resource to primary meal providers. </p>
