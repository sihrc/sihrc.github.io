              Helen is a middle-aged working mother with two children. Helen is very proud of the career that she’s been able to have in the non-profit space. She has led many projects that have led to water sanitization in Africa, dirty/clean water awareness in America, and inner city projects that help immigrants more easily assimilate into American society. In order to keep not only her projects under control, but her household as well, Helen spends a chunk of time on Saturday or Sunday planning meals and meal times a week in advance. She is very focused on time efficiency in the kitchen and will often freeze some meals that she makes on the weekends to make it easier during the week. She normally goes to the grocery store once a week with a list that she mostly sticks to, but also has a pretty good sense of the staples her family needs every week. When shopping, Helen really tries to buy organic and healthy food because she sees the value in healthy eating and wants those  values for her family. When she cooks, she doesn’t stick to recipes, she likes to see what’s available and cook based on that. She has a collection of tried-and-true base recipes that she can always start with and add her own flare each time she makes it. <a href = "needsanalysis.html#helen">  Back to Needs Analysis</a>

                    Spontaneous freestyle cook, Shawn, is a twenty-six years old, fresh out of college, cooking enthusiast, living in a modest apartment in downtown Boston. During the day Shawn works maintenance at a nearby power plant, while caring small household of about to be 2 - his recently wedded wife and a young unborn child. With the eccentric and whimsical tastes of his hormone-crazed wife, Shawn values bringing creativity to the meals he prepares after his long shifts at the plant. Though not yet accustomed to keeping a stocked kitchen, Shawn is confident in his ability to gather what’s necessary for the next week from the grocer’s. Still climbing the economic ladder, he makes do with his financial affordances at the local grocery market, never missing an opportunity to grab bargain deals on exotic ingredients. Although he often returns home exhausted, Shawn is always open to experimenting with available ingredients to brighten up his days with his wife.<a href = "needsanalysis.html#shawn">  Back to Needs Analysis</a>

                  Elsa is a middle-aged suburban housewife and stay-at-home mother of three. She spends her days taking care of her family and staying in touch with her many friends using her iPhone, most of whom also have kids and busy schedules. Elsa is thrilled by services such as Peapod, which allow her to get food delivered to her door when she needs something for a recipe and doesn’t have the time to run to the store to get it. She enjoys finding new recipes to try on both her family and for hosting dinner parties, and she likes to entertain guests often. A few times a month, she will go to a larger store like Costco to buy more common items in bulk, but normally her grocery shopping consists of her browsing the aisles for items that catch her fancy. She doesn’t feel the need for a strict grocery list because she knows she can order groceries online whenever she needs to, and she goes often enough that she has a sense for what ingredients she will need to make her meals. Busy and bubbly, Elsa loves spending time in the kitchen and is rewarded by the sight of her family and friends enjoying her cooking.<a href = "needsanalysis.html#elsa">  Back to Needs Analysis</a>

                Carol and Corwin are middle aged parents with two children 6 and 8 years old. Carol works at a convalescent hospital as a social worker, and Corwin works as a manager full time, so both are very busy, and come home usually tired. Given the age of their children, however, they value spending as much time as possible with them, kicking balls in the field, helping them with their homework, and eating home-cooked meals together as much as possible (not that they don't enjoy it).

                The limited time in their schedules makes it difficult for them to go grocery shopping often, so they'll make a trip to Stop and Shop once a week, (and more if they find they're running out of ingredients), and plan meals based on whatever's in the fridge. Carol and Corwin do enjoy the variety of foods (which is also healthier for their growing boys), so they sometimes will look up recipes online that use food they currently have (and one or two ingredients they may not have). The new recipes not only provide some entertainment to their routine lives, but keep their boys happy and healthily interested in their foods. 

                After years of living and working together, they've adopted a very natural tag team routine, where one will play with the kids while the other one cooks/shops, and switch "jobs" the next meal.<a href = "needsanalysis.html#couple">  Back to Needs Analysis</a>
