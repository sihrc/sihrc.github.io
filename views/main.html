					Feel stressed out? Need a dose of kitty cuteness? Try out the KittyApp!
					KittyApp is an image searching, viewing, and saving app that finds images of cute kittens (or anything else you wish to search for) and allows you to "adopt" the kittens. This app is meant to brighten up your day by providing cute pictures of kittens. In the future, more interaction with adopted kittens may be implemented if there is enough demand.

					Imagine a mother who is preparing dinner for her family. She opens the refrigerator and looks at the assortment of foods scattered across the shelves. &quot;What can I make for dinner?&quot; she wonders. Nothing catches her eye and she is having a hard time coming up with a creative meal that will be delicious and nutritious for her family. How much easier would it be if she could simply pull out her phone, open an application, and find inspiration by scrolling through a list of meals and recipes that she has found to be tried and true in the past?
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the course of this past semester, our team designed and developed a web application called myDish. The myDish app can be thought of as an individual digital cookbook where users are able to take pictures of the meals they cook, record their recipes and any notes they have on their dishes, and upload them to their own personal feed. This application will not only be a place to store recipes, it will also be a source of inspiration for our users who can open the application and scroll through the dishes they have previously made in order to brainstorm what they can cook for their next meal. Users can use the myDish application in many ways. Some will use it for inspiration while making meal plans in order to cook balanced meals, others will use it to share their exquisite meals with others in order to receive feedback and validation, and still others will use the app to keep track of a set of recipes that they enjoy making.

					Have you ever played the game with your friends where you take turns saying three words at a time, crafting a story together piece by piece. I know that when I have, my friends and I have made some of the funniest stories I've ever heard. So if that's so fun, then why not bring play it all the time. With your friends, with strangers, it doesn't matter, as long as your crafting fun stories together. This is StoryQuilt, and the story you heard at the beginning only one of millions of possibilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					StoryQuilt is a mobile take on the traditional Three-Word-Story game. Using the app, it's simple to create, write to, and read stories made by users just like you around the world. For each story, there's only two things you need to remember: how many words you can post, and how many words you can see. When you enter an existing story, you are only able to see so many of the previous words. This keeps stories exciting and fresh, and most importantly reduces the barrier to entry when posting for the first time in that story. Having read what you can, it's now time to post! But remember, you can only post so many words at a time, so try to keep it interesting for all of the other players. And don't try to post twice! The whole point of the game is to build stories with others so that you never know what's coming! The stories update in real time, so you never have to worry about your post conflicting with another's. Once you feel like you've contributed enough to a story, click the "Posts Later" button and your prompted to become a reader. Readers can no longer write to the story, but they can read the entire thing, allowing them to enjoy the story as a whole. Readers can also continuously follow the story using the Following tab. Finding new story is a snap! Not only can you sort stories by popularity and date, but you can test your luck with the random story button, giving you a set of, you guessed it, random stories! You can also search all stories by title as well. Creating a new story is just as easy as posting in an old one. Simply give it a title, set the word and history limit and write the first post. It's really that easy to start a whole new story.

					WeAchieve is an app that targets increasing the productivity of Olin College students. Through our observations and surveys, we have found that the typical scenario between a student and an assignment is get the assignment, struggle due to a lack of knowledge, become stressed out because they are not making headway, and get easily distracted to avoid the stress. WeAchieve addresses this problem by providing a means of easily setting up working sessions to work on assignments collaboratively with other students. Students who know the material can help others and students will feel less stressed because they are not working through the assignment alone. This app works particularly well with Olin students because the Olin culture and work ethic is built around team work and collaboration.

					Collaborating with Olin's Alumni, we created an application that provided Olin on-campus community services and benefits for Alumni separate from the current on-campus community. Olin Alumni have stated that when they graduate, all the great connections and benefits of Olin that they took for granted disappeared. For example, Olin has community email lists, such as HelpMe (where people request help for various things) and CarpeDiem(Sieze the day! for spontaneos random events). Alumni have expressed that although they still have access to the email list, they do not want to be <i>that</i> creepy alumni stalking the lists. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result, OlumniNetwork creates a new network where Alumni can again use these lists within the Alumni network.

					At Olin we have NINJAS (Need information now just ask), who are basically course assistants. Olin first years are all required to take a specified set of courses of which have a couple of NINJAS. NINJAS are responsible for providing help and checking off assignments.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result on the night before an assignment is due, masses of first years crowd a single lounge in the dorms, trying to get help and trying to get checked off. Currently, the system of order is a hand-written, self-dictated queue on a whiteboard that is frequently unintentionally erased, replaced, or forgotten. People often are skipped, or get stuck in an inevitably long line even though they only need to get checked off. 
				</p>
				<p>
					OlinJa is an app that acts as an online queue with additional features to ease the pain of checkoff sessions. OlinJa is capable of scheduling different sessions, handling one queue for help and one for check-off. The app will also notify people when it is almost their turn. The people ready to be checked off have the option of setting a "available to help others" status and those who need help have a "I need help with this question" status. Some future features might include a gamification of the system where the more people you help, the higher priority you have in the queue. Check out the app!
