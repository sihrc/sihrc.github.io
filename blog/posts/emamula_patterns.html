<h3> Great Job! I have a few comments about some parts of your code below, but none were critical enough to really affect your grade. Since you're doing so well, try scoping the projects out a little bit more for additional challenege! :D</h3>

        mentioning the character related to their location in the book.

        My original concept with this was to analyze Pride and Prejudice
        for sentiments pertaining to Mr. Darcy, a main love interest who
        also happens to be a massive jerk. This seems to track, as many of
        the references to him were negative.
