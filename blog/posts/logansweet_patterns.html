Great job. Make sure you test your code - see below comment! Thanks for adding comments! Generally it's better to put comments on their own lines above the code they are referencing. It helps with the 80 character standard. Don't forget your docstrings! Please see my comments below.

    For each run, type the name of a wikipedia article
    that contains a list of authors. After a very long runtime,
    an ordered pair will be produced. The first element
    is the sentiment value, and the second element is the
    subjectivity value.
