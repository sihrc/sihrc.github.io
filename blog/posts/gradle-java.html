<h2> Building Java Projects and LWJGL </h2>

I've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/pong-the-moba/play-pong-the-moba"> Pong Variant </a> with a friend. Building this project became such an issue. Grabbing dependencies, setting classpaths, packing jars, etc... Here, we'll just go over Gradle in general.
<br><br>
<h3> Using Gradle </h3>
<blockquote>
Gradle is build automation evolved. 
</blockquote>
<i>A little snippet from the site: </i>
<br>
<a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a> can automate the building, testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other types of projects such as generated static websites, generated documentation or indeed anything else. <br>
<br>
Luckily, we had migrated to Gradle early when I joined the team. Originally, we had nice old jars sitting in a libs library and some imported modules for libraries we made edits to... blehh<br><br>


<h3> Getting started </h3>
We need to get Gradle first! I think the easiest way to do this is to use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij</a>. Yes, Intellij IDEA does indeed "work miracles in Java and Beyond". Using Intellij (which has Gradle plugged in), you can create a project using Gradle.

<br> Resulting in: (I like checking the "Create directories for empty content roots automatically" because it makes it easier to see where you're supposed to put your code.)<br>

<br> Here's an example of our Pong Variant's Server Gradle build. Found <a href="https://github.com/Pong-The-Moba/Pong-Server">here</a>. </br>
<pre style="height: 800px"><code class="language-java">//Java plugin, well because Java
apply plugin: 'java' 

//Executable-jar plugin - to pack our server into a nice jar. 
//https://github.com/stigkj/gradle-executable-jar-plugin
apply plugin: 'executable-jar'

//Java source compaitibility - JDK version 1.6 I suppose
sourceCompatibility = 1.6

//Project Version 
version = '1.0'

//Where to look for repositories! 
repositories {
    mavenCentral() //Maven? Yes, please.
}

//main class definition. Yes, this is our main class
mainClass = 'server.PongServer'

//Dependencies! 
//Note :{dir} indicates /{dir} to locate modules to be compiled with our project! 
dependencies {
    //Yum, dependency for our test package.
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.11' 
    //Kryonet our server connection backend! We're getting from maven
    compile 'com.esotericsoftware:kryonet:2.+'                 
    //Link-Pong Module! our core files shared between server and client
    compile project(':Link:Pong')                              
    //jBox2D - our endearing little physics engine...
    compile project(':jbox2d')                                 
}

//For our gradle wrapper packaged in our git repository! Yep, ship gradle with your project. Put it in your VCS! 
task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '1.11'
}

//For our Jar Building
jar {
    baseName = 'pong-the-moba-server'
    version = '0.1.0'
    manifest { //Oh yes our main class again.
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'server.PongServer'
    }
}

//build script! 
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'net.nisgits.gradle:gradle-executable-jar-plugin:1.7.0'
    }
}
</code></pre>
A couple of things to take note of. For module dependencies like :Link:Pong, we need to include a build.gradle file and a settings.gradle if it's a project. Speaking of settings.gradle, any module dependencies need to be included in settings.gradle for gradle to find them, like so: <br>
<pre><code class="language-java">include ':Server'
include ':Link:Pong'
include ':jbox2d'
</code></pre>
And for maven repositories, you can usually find them <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jbox2d/jbox2d/2.1.2.2">here</a>, and they usually have a gradle tab that shows you what to put in the dependency block. I'm still very much a novice at Gradle, so if you have any corrections to make to this post ... please let me know! I'll be adding a contact me section at some point .. but for now - my contact information can be obtained from my website somewhere (sorry).
