Great job. The scope of this assignment might be a little too narrow. Doesn't seem like you've done anything really interesting with the results. Perhaps, a good direction to go is some kind of visualization of the data, or seeing these trends over time and correlating them with other things that happened during the time. I'm glad you added docstrings. Please see my comments below.
