Why do you want to be a PM at Microsoft?

I'm passionate about learning new different technologies, how people use technology, and what technology means to people. I want to be the driving force of a team to further technology so that it brings more meaning and value to people. I enjoy working at a high level and driving a project forward while being able to learn about every part of a project. I think I would be a great fit at Microsoft because I have a lot to offer and a lot of potential to grow.


What are some of your leadership experiences?

I have had a lot of experience in education. I've been a peer tutor and a course assistant, teaching a couple of classes like software design, mechanics, and various other subjects. I've also taught a younger audience, middle schoolers English and the American culture. You might be wondering why I'd consider education a leadership experience.
I think teaching requires great communication skills, the ability to empathize with others, and the ability to motivate others.

As a leader on a team, my goal is to make sure the team is successful. There are really 3 key points to success for a team: trust, communication, and motivation. To me, trust in this context me trusting teammates to have the same overall goal as me.

What kinds of problems have you experienced?

One especially stressfull situation I've been in was on a team in Principles of Engineering, doing a semester long project. First, I had to find out why people weren't showing to meetings. Why people weren't getting what they need to get done done.
